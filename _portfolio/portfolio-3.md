PETANI - Penyiraman Tanaman Otomatis Inhouse

Developed a closed loop system IoT to water plant based on environtment variables (humidity and temperature), consisting of :

Microcontroller & Backend used:
=====
* ESP-32 DevKit
* Arduino IDE & C language
* Proteus & Fritzing for CAD drawing
* MQTT Protocol 
* Ubidots for webpage
* Linear Regression method to calibrate Soil Moisture

Actuator:
=====
* DC Fan for temperature control
* DC Selenoid Valve for water control

Another Hardware:
=====
* Capacitive Soil Moisture (Humidity)
* DHT22 (Temperature)
* 2 Channel DC Relay (Fan & Selenoid Control)
